        <p>
          I'm a passionate web developer with experience in front-end technologies.

          I love building intuitive, dynamic, and responsive websites. My skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and more.

          Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and grow as a developer. I have attended the IDEAS College Project Competition and reached the finals, and also participated in the NIT Hackathon , where I had the opportunity to collaborate with talented individuals.
